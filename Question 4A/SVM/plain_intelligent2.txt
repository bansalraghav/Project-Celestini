GESTURE RECOGNITION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION ARE ADVANCING AT AN EXPONENTIAL RATE IN THE PASSING YEARS HAND GESTURE RECOGNITION HAS BEEN A FASCINATING RESEARCH AREA HAND GESTURE RECOGNITION SYSTEM PROVIDES US A NOVEL NATURAL INNOVATIVE USER FRIENDLY WAY OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE COMPUTERS GESTURE RECOGNITION HAS VARIED AREA OF APPLICATION INCLUDING HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION SIGN LANGUAGE GAME PLAYING ETC HAND GESTURE RECOGNITION HAVE ENORMOUS IN HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION AND ROBOTIC MACHINERIES TODAY INTERFACES BETWEEN HUMAN AND COMPUTER ARE MOUSE AND KEYBOARD ARE BUT IN NEAR FUTURE HAND AND EYE GESTURES WOULD REPLACE IT THROUGH THIS APPLICATION WE CAN IDENTIFY THE NUMBER OF FINGERS OF OUR HAND WE CAN TRIGGER ON EVENT USING PREDEFINED GESTURE SCENARIOS HAND GESTURE RECOGNITION ALSO PROVIDES A LOW COST INTERFACES DEVICE FOR INTERACTING WITH OBJECTS IN VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT USING HAND GESTURES THE MAIN PARTS OF SYSTEM ARE HAND DETECTION FINGER DETECTION FINGER COUNT AND EVENT TRIGGERING HAND DETECTION IS THE INCEPTION THAT INVOLVES HAND SEGMENTATION IT IS A COLOUR BASED HAND GESTURES RECOGNITION SO DIFFERENT HAND GESTURE COLOUR ARE FIRST TAKEN AND THEN THRESHOLD IS SET MANUALLY FINGER IDENTIFICATION INVOLVES IDENTIFICATION OF TWO TYPES OF POINTS IDENTIFIED AS CONVEX POINTS ARE DEFECT POINTS CONVEX NULL POINTS ARE USED TO DETECT THE FINGERS FINGER COUNT IS PERFORMED WITH THE CONVEX HULL POINTS WHEN WE ARE USING OUR FULL HAND THERE ARE CONVEXITY DEFECTS SO WE NEED DEFECT POINTS TO FIND CENTER OF HAND AND DETECT THE INDEX FINGER EVENTS TRIGGERING INVOLVES TRIGGERING AN EVENT WHEN PREDEFINED NUMBER OF FINGERS ARE DETECTED HAND GESTURE RECOGNITION IS IDENTIFYING EXPRESSIONS WHICH ARE MEANINGFUL OF THE HAND OR HAND IN MOTION HAND GESTURES ARE USED IN OUR DAILY LIFE AS A NONVERBAL METHOD OF COMMUNICATION GESTURES ARE ACTIONS THAT CONTAIN SOME MEANINGFUL MESSAGES THERE ARE NUMBER OF SYSTEMS USED IN INPUT SYSTEM FOR COMPUTER INTERACTION SUCH AS MOUSE KEYBOARD BUT IN EARLY YEARS THERE WERE NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES FOR GESTURE RECOGNITION ON TRACKING SUCH AS INSTRUMENTAL GLOWS AND OPTICAL MARKERS ETC BUT THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY IS TO IDENTIFY HAND GESTURES VIA WEBCAM THIS PAPER INTRODUCES HAND GESTURES RECOGNITION SYSTEM WHICH USES HAND GESTURES FOR COMPUTER INTERACTION HAND SEGMENTATION IS USED TO EXTRACT HAND FROM IMAGETHERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT METHODS FOR HAND SEGMENTATIONTHE MAIN STEPS IN SEGMENTATION ARE THRESHOLDS AND TRANSFOMALS TO OBTAIN MEANINGFUL INFORMATION FROM THE IMAGE AND OBTAIN AREA OF INTEREST TO EXTRACT THE FEATURES PROPER HAND SEGMENTATION IS VITALCOUNTERS ARE CONTINUOUS PARTS OF HAND ALONG THE BOUNDARY WITH SAME COLOR AND INTENSITY IT IS FOUND AFTER THRESHOLD WHEN THE CONVEX HULL IS DRAWN AROUND THE CONTOUR OF THE HAND IT FITS SET OF CONTOUR POINTS OF THE HAND WITHIN THE HULL IT USES MINIMUM POINTS TO FORM THE HULL TO INCLUDE ALL CONTOUR POINTS INSIDE OR ON THE HULL AND MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY OF CONVEXITY THIS CAUSES THE FORMATION OF DEFECTS IN THE CONVEX HULL WITH RESPECT TO THE CONTOUR DRAWN ON HAND  ON BASIS OF IMAGE INTENSITIES WE DIVIDE IMAGE INTO TWO PARTS ONE WITH HAND AND OTHER WITH NON HAND REGION PART THE CENTROID DIVIDES THIS TWO HALVES AT ITS GEOMETRIC CENTER CENTROID IS THE CENTER OF MASS OF AN OBJECT WHICH IS CALCULATED USING IMAGE MOVEMENT IMAGE MOMENT WHICH IS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF PIXELS INTENSITIES OF THE IMAGE THUMB IS IMPORTANT IN HAND DETECTION AND A FINGER COUNTING THE PRESENCE OF THUMB DEFINES A SET OF GESTURES WHILE ABSENCE DEFINES OTHER SET THE THUMB IS ON THE CORNER OF THE BOX SO WE CAN IDENTIFY WHICH HAND IS THERE RIGHT OR LEFT HAND USING THUMB DETECTION THE PROBLEM OF EMPIRICAL DATA MODELLING IS GERMANE TO MANY ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS IN EMPIRICAL DATA MODELLING A PROCESS OF INDUCTION IS USED TO BUILD UP A MODEL OF THE SYSTEM FROM WHICH IT IS HOPED TO DEDUCE RESPONSES OF THE SYSTEM THAT HAVE YET TO BE OBSERVED ULTIMATELY THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE OBSERVATIONS GOVERN THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS EMPIRICAL MODEL BY ITS OBSERVATIONAL NATURE DATA OBTAINED IS FINITE AND SAMPLED TYPICALLY THIS SAMPLING IS NONUNIFORM AND DUE TO THE HIGH DIMENSIONAL NATURE OF THE PROBLEM THE DATA WILL FORM ONLY A SPARSE DISTRIBUTION IN THE INPUT SPACE IF THE UNDERLYING PROCESS BEING MODELLED IS NOT DETERMINISTIC THE MODELLING PROBLEM BECOMES MORE EXACTING AND CONSEQUENTLY THIS CHAPTER IS RESTRICTED TO DETERMINISTIC PROCESSES MULTIPLE OUTPUT PROBLEMS CAN USUALLY BE REDUCED TO A SET OF SINGLE OUTPUT PROBLEMS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED INDEPENDENT HENCE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO CONSIDER PROCESSES WITH MULTIPLE INPUTS FROM WHICH IT IS DESIRED TO PREDICT A SINGLE OUTPUT THE CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM CAN BE RESTRICTED TO CONSIDERATION OF THE TWOCLASS PROBLEM WITHOUT LOSS OF GENERALITY IN THIS PROBLEM THE GOAL IS TO SEPARATE THE TWO CLASSES BY A FUNCTION WHICH IS INDUCED FROM AVAILABLE EXAMPLES THE GOAL IS TO PRODUCE A CLASSIFIER THAT WILL WORK WELL ON UNSEEN EXAMPLES IE IT GENERALISES WELL CONSIDER THE EXAMPLE IN FIGURE  HERE THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE LINEAR CLASSIFIERS THAT CAN SEPARATE THE DATA BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE THAT MAXIMISES THE MARGIN MAXIMISES THE DISTANCE BETWEEN IT AND THE NEAREST DATA POINT OF EACH CLASS THIS LINEAR CLASSIFIER IS TERMED THE OPTIMAL SEPARATING HYPERPLANE INTUITIVELY WE WOULD EXPECT THIS BOUNDARY TO GENERALISE WELL AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHER POSSIBLE BOUNDARIES SO FAR THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN RESTRICTED TO THE CASE WHERE THE TRAINING DATA IS LINEARLY SEPARABLE HOWEVER IN GENERAL THIS WILL NOT BE THE CASE FIGURE  THERE ARE TWO APPROACHES TO GENERALISING THE PROBLEM WHICH ARE DEPENDENT UPON PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEM AND AN ESTIMATE OF THE NOISE ON THE DATA IN THE CASE WHERE IT IS EXPECTED OR POSSIBLY EVEN KNOWN THAT A HYPERPLANE CAN CORRECTLY SEPARATE THE DATA A METHOD OF TO ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THE NONLINEAR SVR SOLUTIONS VARIOUS KERNEL FUNCTIONS WERE USED TO MODEL THE REGRESSION DATA IN TABLE  WITH AN  INSENSITIVE LOSS FUNCTION     AND NO ADDITIONAL CAPACITY CONTROL FIGURE  SHOWS THE SVR SOLUTION FOR A DEGREE  POLYNOMIAL WITH THE SV CIRCLED AS BEFORE THE DOTTED LINE DESCRIBES THE  INSENSITIVE REGION AROUND THE SOLUTION NB IF ALL THE DATA POINTS LIE WITHIN THIS REGION THERE WILL BSVR SOLUTION FOR A LINEAR SPLINE KERNEL THE RESULTING MODEL IS A PIECEWISE CUBIC SPLINE AND AGAIN DUE TO THE HIGH CAPACITY OF THIS FUNCTION IT IS ABLE TO MODEL THE DATA WITH ZERO LOSS FUNCTION ERROR BUT NOTICE THAT OVERFITTING IS CONTROLLED FIGURE  SHOWS THE SVR SOLUTION FOR AN INFINITE BSPLINE KERNEL WHICH HAS A SIMILAR SOLUTION TO THE SPLINE KERNEL EXCEPT FOR THE ENDPOINTS FIGURE  SHOWS THE SOLUTION FOR AN EXPONENTIAL RBF KERNEL WHICH IS A PIECEWISE LINEAR SPLINE ALTHOUGH THIS MODEL HAS A HIGH CAPACITY IT SHOWS SENSIBLE BEHAVIOUR IN THE EXTREMITY REGIONS  HAVE A SMALL UNBALANCED DATA SET  POSITIVE  NEGATIVE AND I HAVE BEEN PLAYING AROUND WITH MODEL SELECTION FOR SVM PARAMETERS USING BAC BALANCED ACCURACY AND AUC AREA UNDER THE CURVE I USED DIFFERENT CLASSWEIGHTS FOR THE C PARAMETER IN LIBSVM TO OFFSET THE UNBALANCED DATA FOLLOWING THE ADVICE HERE TRAINING A DECISION TREE AGAINST UNBALANCED DATAIT SEEMS THAT KFOLD CROSSVALIDATION ERROR IS VERY SENSITIVE TO THE TYPE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURE IT ALSO HAS AN ERROR IN ITSELF BECAUSE THE TRAINING AND VALIDATION SETS ARE CHOSEN RANDOMLY FOR EXAMPLE IF I REPEAT BAC TWICE WITH DIFFERENT RANDOM SEEDS I WILL GET DIFFERENT ERRORS AND SUBSEQUENTLY DIFFERENT OPTIMAL PARAMETER VALUES IF I AVERAGE REPEATED BAC SCORES AVERAGING  TIMES WILL GIVE ME DIFFERENT OPTIMAL PARAMETER VALUES THAN AVERAGING  TIMES MOREOVER CHANGING THE NUMBER OF FOLDS GIVES ME DIFFERENT OPTIMAL PARAMETER VALUESACCURACY METRICS FOR CROSS VALIDATION MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC USUALLY ANYTHING OVER A FOLD CROSSVALIDATION GIVES ME  ACCURACY ALSO THE ERROR RATE IS DISCRETIZED DUE TO SMALL SAMPLE SIZE MODEL SELECTION WILL OFTEN GIVE ME THE SAME ERROR RATE ACROSS ALL OR MOST PARAMETER VALUESWHEN WRITING A REPORT HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT A CLASSIFICATION IS GOOD OR ACCEPTABLE IN THE FIELD IT SEEMS LIKE WE DONT HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A GOODNESS OF FIT OR PVALUE THRESHOLD THAT IS COMMONLY ACCEPTED SINCE I AM ADDING TO THE DATA ITERATIVELY I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHEN TO STOP WHAT IS A GOOD N WHERE THE MODEL DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVEGIVEN THE ISSUES DESCRIBED ABOVE IT SEEMS LIKE ACCURACY CANT BE EASILY COMPARED BETWEEN PUBLICATIONS WHILE AUC HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A POOR INDICATOR FOR PERFORMANCE SEE HERE OR HERE FOR EXAMPLEANY ADVICE ON HOW TO TACKLE ANY OF THESE  PROBLEMSIT SEEMS THAT KFOLD CROSSVALIDATION ERROR IS VERY SENSITIVE TO THE TYPE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURE IT ALSO HAS AN ERROR IN ITSELF BECAUSE THE TRAINING AND VALIDATION SETS ARE CHOSEN RANDOMLYI THINK YOUVE DISCOVERED THE HIGH VARIANCE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT ARE PROPORTIONS OF CASE COUNTS SUCH AS FRACTEXT CORRECT PREDICTIONSTEXT TEST CASES YOU TRY TO ESTIMATE EG THE PROBABILITY THAT YOUR CLASSIFIER RETURNS A CORRECT ANSWER FROM A STATISTICS POINT OF VIEW THAT IS DESCRIBED AS A BERNOULLI TRIAL LEADING TO A BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION YOU CAN CALCULATE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS FOR BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTIONS AND WILL FIND THAT THEY ARE VERY WIDE THIS OF COURSE LIMITS YOUR ABILITY TO DO MODEL COMPARISONWITH RESAMPLING VALIDATION SCHEMES SUCH AS CROSS VALIDATION YOU HAVE AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF VARIATION THE INSTABILITY OF YOUR MODELS AS YOU BUILD K SURROGATE MODELS DURING EACH CV RUNMOREOVER CHANGING THE NUMBER OF FOLDS GIVES ME DIFFERENT OPTIMAL PARAMETER VALUESTHAT IS TO BE EXPECTED DUE TO THE VARIANCE YOU MAY HAVE AN ADDITIONAL EFFECT HERE LIBSVM SPLITS THE DATA ONLY ONCE IF YOU USE THEIR BUILTIN CROSS VALIDATION FOR TUNING DUE TO THE NATURE OF SVMS IF YOU BUILT THE SVM WITH IDENTICAL TRAINING DATA AND SLOWLY VARY THE PARAMETERS YOULL FIND THAT SUPPORT VECTORS AND CONSEQUENTLY ACCURACY JUMPS AS LONG AS THE SVM PARAMETERS ARE NOT TOO DIFFERENT IT WILL STILL CHOOSE THE SAME SUPPORT VECTORS ONLY WHEN THE PARATERS ARE CHANGED ENOUGH SUDDENLY DIFFERENT SUPPORT VECTORS WILL RESULT SO
